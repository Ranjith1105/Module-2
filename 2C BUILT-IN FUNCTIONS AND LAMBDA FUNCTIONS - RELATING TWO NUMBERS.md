## BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS - MULTIPLICATION USING FUNCTION ASSIGNED TO VARIABLE


---

### AIM  
To create a Python function that takes three arguments a, b, and c, returns their product a * b * c, and assigns the function to a variable named f.

---

### ALGORITHM
1.Begin the program.
2.Define a function using def or lambda that takes three parameters: a, b, and c.
3.The function should return the result of a * b * c.
4.Assign the function to a variable named f.
5.Take three numeric inputs from the user.
6.Call the function f with the input values.
7.Display the result.
8.Terminate the program.
